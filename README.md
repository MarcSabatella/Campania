# Campania
Font for Roman numeral analysis (music theory)

This font is inspired by the work of [Florian Kretlow](https://github.com/fkretlow)
and the impressive [Figurato](https://github.com/fkretlow/figurato) font he developed for figured bass,
as well as the work of Ronald Caltabiano and his pioneering Sicialian Numerals font.
This current version of Campania is not directly based on either of these, however.
Instead, it uses the glyphs from [FreeSerif](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/),
and adds some ligatures and relatively straightforward contextual substitutions
to allow you to enter the most common symbols just by typing naturally.
I do plan to extend the font over time, but I am not sure if I will continue with this simple approach.
Future versions of the font may incorporate more of the positioning approaches used in Figurato,
or a new font may be developed that inherits from it more directly.

To use Campania, simply type as you normally would, and substitutions happen automatically.
The standard indications for inversions and seventh chords (e.g., 6, 7, 64, 643, 43)
are superscripted and turned into appropriate vertically-stacked ligatures.
When used in a context where this makes sense,
"b" and "#" turn into flat and sharp, and
"o" and "0" turn into diminished and half-diminished symbols, etc.

This font should work in any program that handles fonts reasonably.
It is tested to work in [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) and in [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/),
and will probably work in the commercial alternatives as well.
